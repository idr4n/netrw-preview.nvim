## Motivation

The main motivation to write this plugin was to add a **live preview** to Netrw similar to `oil.nvim` or `mini.files`. 

I find Netrw quite powerful with many useful features. Although I have used other alternatives over the years (e.g., `Nvimtree`, `Neo-tree`, `Oil.nvim`, `Mini.files`), I wanted to get comfortable using netrw since it is the built-in file manager in Neovim. However, despite its built-in preview functionality, it opens files you're previewing as actual buffers. This leaves numerous unwanted buffers open at the end of your session, which I find undesirable.

Along the way, I decided to also include other enhancements to improve my own workflow in Netrw, similar in some ways to `vim-vinegar` and `dirvish.vim`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of files and directories as you navigate
- **Flexible Preview Layout**: Choose vertical or horizontal splits with configurable positioning and sizing
- **Smart File Detection**: Automatically detects and handles non-text files with file size information
- **Smart Enter Navigation**: Intelligent file/directory opening with proper alternate buffer handling
- **Flexible Directory Shortcuts**: Create custom keybindings for frequently accessed directories
- **Dynamic Path Support**: Use functions for context-aware directory navigation
- **Multiple Key Support**: Assign multiple keys to the same action for maximum flexibility
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved keybindings for better netrw workflow
- **File Operations**: Quick path copying, insertion, and navigation utilities, ala `vim-vinager`
- **Reveal Functionality**: Jump to current file in netrw from any buffer
- **Command-Based Interface**: Use commands for flexible external mapping
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize preview window size and layout, keybindings, and behavior

## üì¶ Installation

#### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "idr4n/netrw-preview.nvim",
  ft = "netrw",
  keys = {
    { ",,", "<cmd>NetrwRevealToggle<cr>", desc = "Toggle Netrw - Reveal" },
    { ",l", "<cmd>NetrwRevealLexToggle<cr>", desc = "Toggle Netrw (Lex) - Reveal" },
    { "ga", "<cmd>NetrwLastBuffer<cr>", desc = "Go to alternate buffer (with netrw reveal)" },
  },
  opts = {}
}
```

#### Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  "idr4n/netrw-preview.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("netrw-preview").setup()
  end
}
```

#### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'idr4n/netrw-preview.nvim'
```

Then add to your `init.lua`:
```lua
require("netrw-preview").setup()
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration


<details>
<summary>üìã Default Configuration</summary>

<br>


```lua
require("netrw-preview").setup({
  -- Preview window width as percentage of total width (for vertical splits)
  preview_width = 60,

  -- Preview window height as percentage of total height (for horizontal splits)
  preview_height = 60,

  -- Preview window layout orientation
  preview_layout = "vertical", -- "vertical" or "horizontal"

  -- Side to open preview window
  preview_side = "right", -- "left" or "right" for vertical, "above" or "below" for horizontal

  -- Enable preview by default when entering netrw
  preview_enabled = false,

  -- Auto-open netrw on startup if no file is specified
  -- Note: Requires no lazy loading to take effect
  auto_open_netrw = false,

  -- Key mappings
  mappings = {
    -- Enable/disable all mappings
    enabled = true,

    -- Toggle preview window
    toggle_preview = "p",

    -- Keys to close netrw (multiple options)
    close_netrw = { "q", "gq", "<c-q>" },

    -- Navigate to parent directory
    parent_dir = "h",

    -- Enter directory/open file (smart enter)
    enter_dir = { "l", "<cr>" },

    -- Insert relative path in command line
    insert_path = ".",

    -- Yank absolute path to clipboard
    yank_path = "Y",

    -- Custom directory shortcuts
    directory_mappings = {
      { key = "~", path = "~", desc = "Home directory" },
    },
  }
})
```

</details>


### üîß Flexible Key Mappings

All mappings support both single keys and multiple keys for the same action:

```lua
require("netrw-preview").setup({
  mappings = {
    -- Single key
    toggle_preview = "p",

    -- Multiple keys for same action
    close_netrw = { "q", "gq", "<c-q>", "<esc>" },
    parent_dir = { "h", "<BS" },
    enter_dir = { "l", "<CR>" },

    -- Disable with {}, empty string or false
    yank_path = {},         -- Disabled
    insert_path = "",       -- Also disabled
  }
})
```


### Example Custom Configuration

```lua
require("netrw-preview").setup({
  preview_width = 70,           -- Wider preview window (vertical splits)
  preview_height = 30,          -- Preview height (horizontal splits)
  preview_layout = "horizontal",-- Use horizontal split
  preview_side = "below",       -- Preview below netrw
  preview_enabled = true,       -- Auto-enable preview
  mappings = {
    toggle_preview = "<space>",
    close_netrw = { "q", "<Esc>" },
    yank_path = "yy",
    last_buffer = "",           -- diabled mapping, also false or {}
    directory_mappings = {
      { key = "~", path = "~", desc = "Home directory" },
      { key = "gd", path = "~/Downloads", desc = "Downloads directory" },
      -- relative path
      { key = "gs", path = "../../src", desc = "Source directory" },
      -- dynamic path
      { key = "gw", path = function() return vim.fn.getcwd() end, desc = "Current working directory" },
    },
  }
})
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Navigation


| Key                | Action                                    |
| -----              | --------                                  |
| `p`                | Toggle preview window                     |
| `q`, `gq`, `<c-q>` | Close netrw and return to previous buffer |
| `h`                | Go to parent directory                    |
| `l`                | Enter directory or open file              |
| `~`                | Go to home directory                      |


### üß† Smart Enter Feature

The `l` key (or your configured `enter_dir` mapping) provides intelligent behavior:

- **On directories**: Normal navigation (same as `<CR>`)
- **On files**: Opens file AND preserves proper alternate buffer context
  - If opening the same file you came from ‚Üí alternate = previous alternate buffer
  - If opening a different file ‚Üí alternate = file you came from

This creates intuitive buffer navigation when jumping between files via netrw.

### File Operations


| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Y` | Yank absolute path to clipboard |
| `.` | Insert relative path in command line |


### Preview Features

- **File Preview**: Shows file contents with syntax highlighting
- **Directory Preview**: Shows directory contents with folders listed first
- **Binary Files**: Displays file information for binary files
- **Large Files**: Automatically truncates large files (>500 lines) for performance
- **Layout Options**: Choose between vertical (left/right) or horizontal (above/below) preview splits
- **Customizable Sizing**: Configure preview window width for vertical splits or height for horizontal splits

| `:NetrwLastBuffer`           | Smart alternate buffer with netrw reveal                    |
| `:NetrwPreviewToggle`        | Toggle preview window                                       |
| `:NetrwPreviewEnable`        | Enable preview                                              |
| `:NetrwPreviewDisable`       | Disable preview                                             |
| `:NetrwRevealFile [path]`    | Reveal specified file or open directory in netrw            |
| `:NetrwRevealFileLex [path]` | Reveal specified file or open directory in netrw (Lexplore) |


### Commands usage

`NetrwReveal`, `NetrwRevealLex` (and their toggle counterparts), and `NetrwLastBuffer` can be mapped globally as:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", ",,", "<cmd>NetrwReveal<cr>", { desc = "Open Netrw - Reveal current file" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "ga", "<cmd>NetrwLastBuffer<cr>", { desc = "Go to alternate buffer (with netrw reveal)" })
```

**NetrwRevealFile Examples:**

- Reveal current file (if no argument provided)

    `:NetrwRevealFile`

- Reveal specific file

    `:NetrwRevealFile /path/to/file.txt`

- Open directory in netrw

    `:NetrwRevealFile /path/to/directory`

    `:NetrwRevealFile ~/projects`

- Works with relative paths

    `:NetrwRevealFile ./lua/config/init.lua`

    `:NetrwRevealFile ../docs`

**NetrwLastBuffer Logic:**

- **From regular file to file**: uses `vim.cmd('edit #')` to ensure the alternate buffer appears in the buffer list if closed
- **From netrw**: uses `vim.cmd('buffer #')` to just switch to alternate buffer (usually a regular file)
- **From regular file to netrw**: uses `vim.cmd('edit #')` plus file reveal logic (as long as the file is in the same netrw directory)

The other commands (`NetrwPreviewToggle`, `NetrwPreviewEnable`, `NetrwPreviewDisable`) are designed to be used from within netrw buffers.
